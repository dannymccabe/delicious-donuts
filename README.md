# Custom Shopify Store 

## What's Going On?
I set up a shopify partner store for the back end. I linked it to the hydrogen front end using a demo store initially for set up. Styling is tailwind.css, language is javascript. Hydrogen is the new Shopify React Framework. 
Adding new products and adjusting the site will be easy for the client using the Shopify dashboard. 



# Hydrogen Demo Store

Hydrogen is a React framework and SDK that you can use to build fast and dynamic Shopify custom storefronts.

[Check out the docs](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen)

[Run this template on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/Shopify/hydrogen/tree/stackblitz/templates/demo-store)

## Getting started

**Requirements:**

- Node.js version 16.5.0 or higher
- Yarn

To create a new Hydrogen app, run:

```bash
npm init @shopify/hydrogen
```

## Running the dev server

Then `cd` into the new directory and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Remember to update `hydrogen.config.js` with your shop's domain and Storefront API token!

## Building for production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Previewing a production build

To run a local preview of your Hydrogen app in an environment similar to Oxygen, build your Hydrogen app and then run `npm run preview`:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
